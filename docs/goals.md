# Comic CMS 2 Goals

Things that I plan on implementing.

- Keeping module count and install size small.
- Full Text search.
- Animated navigation.
- Fast loading times for the client.
- Smooth animations between comic pages.
- Saving most recently read comic for returning users.

# Comic CMS 2 Possible Future Features

- More dynamic / interesting theming.

# Comic CMS 2 Non-goals

- Ability to upload comics to the site. I don't need this feature personally and it adds a lot of complexity to the app.
Instead, adding a comic can be done on a user's computer and then the new comic can be pushed up as a statically built site.
- Tags. Also add some complication and are not needed.
